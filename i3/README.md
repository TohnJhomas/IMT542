### IMT542 - Individual Assignment 3
# Build a light-weight application to visualize, analyze, predict, or automate
Author: John Thomas  
Edited: April 17, 2025
## Assigment:

Build a lightweight application to visualize, analyze, predict, or automate using one of the sources from a previous assignment or select a new set of information. Create a Readme.md page using markdown to describe the application, including download and running instructions in Github. If the repository is not public, provide the grader and instructor with access to it. See the URL below for an example Python application. Feel free to make it as simple or as complex as you would like.

A Readme.md file in your repository tells other people why your project is useful, what they can do with it, and how to install the required libraries/dependencies and use it.

## Project Description
This project queries all of the poems (limit 200) written by a given author, and then displays a chart of the number of words of a given length, and tables of the longest words and the most common words in the poetry corpus

## Using This Project
 
 Set the name of the poet you want to search for in the line 116 of main.py, the first line under `if __name__ == "__main__"` and run that file directly.
